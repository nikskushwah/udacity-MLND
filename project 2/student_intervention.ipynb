    "**Answer: **\n",
    "The three models I choose are :- Decision tree, support vector machines (svm) and adaboost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree--\n",
    "\n",
    "General applications, strengths and weakness: \n",
    "Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used   for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by  learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "Requires little data preparation.\n",
    "The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable.\n",
    "Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",
    "Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why choose this model: Decision Trees is a good classification tool. It is capable of performing multi-class classification on a dataset. Because we have relative large features in our dataset, Decision Trees would be a potential cadidate.\n",

    "SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "General applications, strengths and weakness: SVMs are a set of learning methods used for classification, regression and outlier detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (support vectors), so it's also memory efficient.\n",
    "Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the method is likely to give poor performances.\n",
    "SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why choose this model: This is two-category classification problem. Comparing to the training size, the feature size is reasonable. We can take advantage of the kernel function in SVMs to separate two kinds of different students.\n",

    "ADABOOST\n",
    "\n",
    "General applications, strengths and weakness: Boosting is an algorithm that uses the weighted average of many weak classifiers (in the case of AdaBoost, its linear hyperplanes) to predict the output class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "One advantage of this algorithm is that its weighting is updated during each iteration to incentivize the correctly classify points in the next iteration that it got wrong in the previous iteration. \n",
    "In theory this helps the algorithm find a good fit to the data.\n",
    "Also, since it is an ensemble method (averaging outputs of other models) it has the property that is should generalize well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "The real drawback for this approach is the time it takes to train.\n",
    "Essentially, a linear hyperplane decision boundary gets fit to the data during each iteration, and then those hyperplanes are weighted averaged together.\n",
    "That’s a lot of computation that the school might not want due to their concerns over cost and processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why choose this model:\n",
    "an ensemble of Decision Trees will always outperform a single decision tree. Given that the data set size is quite small (300 data points), the Decision Tree might tend to overfit so a boosted ensemble of Decision Trees might be worth trying."

    "Based on the experiments performed earlier, I'd say the best model is the Gradient Boosted Trees Classifier (GBT).\n",
    "In terms of training time, the GBT is at most 70 times slower than the SVM and the DT models, with figures at 76ms for GBT, 1.1ms for both SVMs and DTs for the 300 data set training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I still stick with GBT, because even though much slower that SVMs and DTs, the actual training times are very small and negligible, with at most 76 ms for GBT for the 300 data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for prediction times, GBT seem to have much smaller times than SVMs and DTs. The figures stand at around 1ms and 4ms for the training and test prediction times for GBT respectively, while for SVMs it's slightly more time - 4.8ms for training and 1.4ms for testing. And finally for DT it's still abit slower for training (2ms) but faster for testing (2ms). These are all figures for the size 300 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd argue for GBT (in tie with DT) in this case because the I believe testing might be more important than training, as testing might be done on an on-going basis while training might only be done once in a while, say at the beginning/end of an academic year.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for computational times, GBTs win in tie with DT, and might be significantly faster than SVMs for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for accuracy, GBTs are much better than DT (0.8000 for GBTs and 0.7692 for DTs for size 300 dataset), but slightly worse than SVMs (0.8366 for SVMs for size 300 dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "So GBTs are preferred to DTs in terms of accuracy. This is also because DTs tend to overfit, while GBTs ease the \n",
    "overfit problem of DTs by taking an ensemble of many different weak DTs.\n",
