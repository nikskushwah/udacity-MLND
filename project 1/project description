Project Description

The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you’ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your client’s home.

For this assignment, you can find the boston_housing.ipynb file as a downloadable in the Resources section. You may also visit our Projects GitHub to have access to all of the projects available for this Nanodegree. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. You can find the included questions for reference on the following slide. Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.

Software and Libraries

For this project, you will need to have the following software and Python libraries installed:

Python 2.7
NumPy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
iPython Notebook
Deliverables

The following files should be included as your submission, and can be packaged as a single .zip file:

The boston_housing.ipynb file with fully implemented, functional code, with all code blocks executed and showing output.
An HTML or PDF report of the project (you may either export the notebook as HTML with your answers included, or submit a separate PDF with only the questions and your answers).
